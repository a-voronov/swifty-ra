# Swifty RA ☀️

Relational Algebra in Swift.

## TODO
- provide verbose errors & user-friendly description (especially if complex query processing fails)
- rewrite eager to lazy query processing (custom iterators?)
- tests and refactoring (value operations, functions, query processing, tuples, etc)
- suport more value types
- support indexing and primary keys
- think of foreign keys
- optimize query tree
- serialize/deserialize to/from Relation
- think of DSL
